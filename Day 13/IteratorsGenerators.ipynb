    "* Iterators and Generators allow you to customize the behavior of for...of loops\n",
    "* An iterator is an object which defines a sequence of values and optionally a final return value\n",
    "* An iterator object implements the Iterator protocol (```next()``` method)\n",
    "* The ```next()``` method returns an object with two properties:\n",
    "    - ```value``` is next value in the iteration sequence\n",
    "    - ```done``` is true if and only if the last value in the sequence has been consumed\n",
    "* An iterator object can be iterated explicitly by repeatedly calling next()\n",
    "* After a terminating value is yielded then subsequent calls to ```next()``` return ```{done: true}```\n",
    "* The most common iterator in JavaScript is the Array iterator\n",
    "* Arrays are allocated in their entirety, but iterators are consumed only as necessary\n",
    "* Iterators can express sequences of unlimited size"
