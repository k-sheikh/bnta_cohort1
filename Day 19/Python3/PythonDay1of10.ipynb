    "**NOTE**: As usual, there will be topics that we did not discuss in lecture that you will most likely want to make use of in this lab. Be prepared to google search as necessary, or ask questions in class during the lab to resolve any issues. At this point in the class, it is not required that you use any advanced syntax, however, you may use any language features that you like. In most cases, your code in this lab will be fairly simple. You can easily find and copy/paste code you find on the web without the need of deep understanding. As is the case in real work world, the key is to see how resourceful you can become in resolving issues as they come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search for, run, and discuss simple code examples, such as those at: https://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms\n",
    "2. Begin to explore learning resources such as:\n",
    "  - **For Beginners** https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers\n",
    "  - **More Advanced** https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html\n",
    "  - **Python Docs** https://www.python.org/doc\n",
    "  - **Python Quick Reference Guide** https://www.brianheinold.net/python/Python_Quick_Reference_Guide_Heinold.pdf\n",
    "3. Try writing code that reads keyboard input and writes console output, such as the following:\n",
    " - Prompt the user for first and last name and then display the resulting full name as output\n",
    " - Prompt the user for a number and then display the square root of that number as output\n",
    " - Prompt the user for three numbers and then display the mean value of those numbers as output\n",
    " - Prompt the user for two whole numbers and then display the GCD as output\n",
    " - Prompt the user for an arbitrary number of numbers and then display the mean value of those numbers as output\n",
    " - Display the prime numbers up to 100\n",
    " - Display the millionth largest prime number\n",
    " - Prompt the user for quadratic coefficients and display the resulting roots using complex number\n",
    " - Try your own examples drawn from your own imagination or example you find on the web\n",
    "4. Be prepared to present and discuss your code in class\n",

    "\n",
    "In this first lab you will begin work on building your own personal code portfolio, which will become an important component of your resume. The links listed below contain many code challenges of varying difficulty. Initially, most of these challenges may be too difficult for a beginner, but you are encouraged to push yourself to accomplish more than you think you can each day. Not being able to solve a problem immediately is not a failure. As a programmer learns more, it becomes clear that you will always be trying to understand and accomplish something new. This requires that you never give up. With perseverance, you will eventually prove to yourself that you can do just about anything you set your mind to. This is the most important lesson of all.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must discuss your difficulties and your questions with the other students and with the instructor on ```slack.com```or in class as required, but always research the problem sufficiently to be sure that your questions are thoughtful and not obviously answered via trivial web searching. However, do not go for too long without seeking help if you are stuck, and never feel embarrassed to ask a thoughtful question. Spinning your wheels and not moving forward is a serious mistake that will not be tolerated in the workplace. Your workplace comrades will be much more supportive if you show initiative and diligence on your part, but do not be shy to reach out for help. Teamwork is extremely important.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these code challenge web sites, you can also experiment with writing your own code examples, and putting it up on GitHub Gists. Initially you can start off with very simple code examples and gradually work towards greater complexity. For example, see if you can find a clever faster way to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 1000, or calculate a factorial, etc. You can also copy/paste interesting examples you find on the Web that you can study, and tweak, and modify in interesting ways. Eventually, you may try computing the millionth prime number, or approximating the value of Ï€ using a Taylor Series approximation. Perhaps after you finish this course, you may start exploring advanced Data Structures and Algorithms. After that, the sky is the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, start with an easy problem. For some students that might be just a simple *Hello World* example (to see what that means, just google search: Python Hello World). Google search is an important tool for every programmer. Other, more experienced students, may explore more complex problems, such as calculating and displaying the sum on the first N integers.\n",
