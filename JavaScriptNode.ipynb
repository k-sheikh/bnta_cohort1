    "# JavaScript and Node (8 Day)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: Technical Skills, Independent Learning, and Collaboration** This course focuses on three distinct learning objectives. The first, and most obvious objective, is to develop practical JavaScript programming technical skills. However, and perhaps even more importantly, this course strives to develop effective learning strategies and collaboration skills. The ultimate goal is not to learn a long list of detailed facts presented in class, but rather to become an effective life-long learner and a dependable team member. For this reason, you will be given homework assignments that are open-ended, requiring some interpretation, research, and diligence on the part of the student. You are then expected to collaborate and share resources and knowledge that you have discovered with your fellow students. This feedback will be shared in class in the form of student teach-backs and presentations. This knowledge should also be shared outside of class on slack.com. The instructor and all students should check slack.com at least once per day for updates. In addition to technical knowledge, independent learning and collaborative communication skills are important for SDEs in the real world.\n",

    "- **JavaScript Popularity** https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index\n",
    "- **JavaScript**, alongside HTML and CSS, is one of the three core technologies of Web pages\n",
    "- **ECMAScript** is the official standard JavaScript language specification\n",
    "- **Client-Server** JavaScript is used in the browser on the client and also on the web server running on **Node.js**\n",
    "- **JavaScript** is also often used with **Node.js** to run software development tools like **npm**, **Webpack**, **React CLI**, etc.\n",
    "- **Mobile Apps** run JavaScript directly on many devices using mobile frameworks such as Electron and Cordova\n",
    "- **JavaScript Syntax** uses curly-bracketed and semicolon-based syntax just like C, C++, Java, and C#\n",
    "- **Dynamic Data Typing** means that JavaScript code is flexible with runtime data typing\n",
    "- **Dynamically Interpreted** means that JavaScript is interpreted at runtime rather than first being statically compiled\n",
    "- **Prototype-Based** means that JavaScript implements inheritance and object-orientation using a prototype chain\n",
    "- **First-Class Functions** means that JavaScript can work with functions as actual objects (functional programming)\n",
    "- **Inherently Single-Threaded** means that JavaScript runs in an isolated execution context (but WebWorkers can also be used)\n",
    "- **JSON** is supported by JavaScript as a built-in data encoding format\n",
    "- **NPM** is the standard package manager tool used in **Node.JS** environments\n",
