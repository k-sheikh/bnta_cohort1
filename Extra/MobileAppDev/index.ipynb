Android apps can be developed and tested on Windows, Mac, or Linux machines and they can be deployed on Android or iOS devices. Note that an Ionic apps may have slightly lower runtime performance and may support slightly fewer advanced features than an equivalent native app running directly on an Android or native iOS device.

    "**NOTE**: Whereas Android apps can be developed on just about any computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux), and they can be run on any Android compliant mobile device (Samsung, Huawei, etc.), in contrast, iOS development is much more restrictive. Unfortunately, iOS apps can only be developed on a Mac and they can only be run on Apple mobile devices such as an iPhone. Since many students do not have the required hardware for that, this course will not have an official lab or homework on iOS development. However, if you have the required Apple hardware, you may choose to follow some of the links provided below in this section and study iOS app development on your own. As an alternative, you can use the cross-platform Ionic Framework described above to develop your app on Windows, Mac, or Linux and deploy it to Android or iOS devices. iOS development makes use of Objecive-C or Swift using the Xcode developer toolchain.\n",
