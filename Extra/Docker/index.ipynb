    "**NOTE:** This Docker topic is intentionally very brief. Using Docker to its fullest capabilities requires much more time and effort than is possible in this course. We are only trying to get the basic ideas of what it is, how it works, and some of the terminologies, along with a few of the simplest and most common Docker commands to get you started on learning more on your own. After the course is completed, it is recommended that you continue to study some of the deeper aspects, since Docker is an important tool used by programmers and system administrators.\n"

    "## Why Use Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers are lightweight portable containers that help software developers and administrators develop and deploy software in a manageable, repeatable, consistent, scalable, and agile way. Because multiple developers can use exactly the same operating system configuration as the other developers on the team, they all benefit from the consistency and homogeneity of their development environment. This consistency also makes it much easier to deploy and scale servers on the cloud, all with exactly identical operating system images. This helps with many could computing deployment challenges, including reliability, scalability and security.\n"

    "## Docker vs Traditional VMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker uses lightweight OS-level virtualization to run guest operating systems in containers. Instead of virtualizing the entire underlying Virtual Machine, a container runs directly on the underlying host operating system. This makes it more efficient than a traditional hypervisor-based VMs. For example, a container does not need to boot the hosted operating system kernel, so it can start running very quickly. Docker also tends to be more efficient with hardware resources, such as memory consumption and execution time.\n",
