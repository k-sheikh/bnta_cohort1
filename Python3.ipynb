    "**NOTE: Python 2 vs Python 3** This course is focused on Python 3 rather than Python 2. Python was first released by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Then Python 2.0 was released in 2000, which was finally deprecated in 2020 (version 2.7 was the last and final version of Python 2). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 as a major version change. Python 3 is not entirely backward compatible with Python 2, so Python 2 code  must often be modified to run in a Python 3 runtime environment. There are still many tutorials and code examples on the web that pertain to Python 2, so when searching for Python information and code examples, always be sure you are looking at search results that are Python 3 specific to avoid confusion. However, there is a Python tool named ```2to3``` that can help automate the migration of Python 2 code to Python 3 code. See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: Technical Skills, Independent Learning, and Collaboration** This course focuses on three distinct learning objectives. The first, and most obvious objective, is to develop practical Python programming technical skills. However, and perhaps even more importantly, this course strives to develop effective learning strategies and collboration skills. The ultimate goal is not to learn a long list of detailed facts presented in class, but rather to become an effective life-long learner and a dependable team member. For this reason, you will be given homework assignments that are open-ended, requiring some interpretation, research, and diligence on the part of the student. You are then expected to collaborate and share resources and knowledge that you have discovered with your fellow students. This feedback will be shared in class in the form of student teach-backs and presentations. This knowledge should also be shared outside of class on ```slack.com```. The instructor and all students should check ```slack.com``` at least once per day for updates. In addition to technical knowledge, independent learning and collaborative communication skills are important for SDEs in the real world.\n",
