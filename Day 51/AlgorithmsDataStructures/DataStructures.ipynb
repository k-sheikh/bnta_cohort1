    "\n",
    "A data structure is a programmer-defined object designed for efficiently storing and manipulating data. It contains data members that represent the internal state of the data structure, and it exposes methods that are used to access and modify that internal state data. A data structure typically contains data values that are organized in ways that are useful for specific use cases, such as collections that are internally structured as arrays, lists, trees, graphs, sets, maps, dictionaries, matrices, etc.\n",

    "## Linear Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear data structure contains elements arranged in sequence. Each element is positioned between its previous and next elements. For example, an array is a simple linear data structure implemented as contiguous elements stored sequentially in computer memory. More complex linear data structures are: List, Queue, Stack, etc.\n",

    "## Sort Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A sort algorithm reorganizes the elements in a list according to some well-defined ordering rule, such as ascending or descending numerical or lexicographical order. Data that has been sorted has many advantages over unsorted data. For example, the fastest search algorithms perform most efficiently on data that has been pre-sorted in some specific way.\n",

    "A search algorithm is any algorithm that retrieves specific information from a data structure, according to specific query criteria that defines a matching rule. \n",

    "## Simple Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple tree is an abstract data type that simulates a general hierarchical tree structure. It has a root node. Under that root node, there can be any number of children nodes, each of which can be the parent of further child subtree nodes. Along with the information that determines the hierarchical structure of the tree, each node also has the capacity to store a data structure element. Trees often enable more efficient algorithms, using a divide and conquer approach, that can be much faster than using a linear data structure alternative.\n",

    "## Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is an abstract data type that implements an undirected or directed graph as defined in the field of mathematics known as \"Graph Theory\". A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (vertices) along with a set of pairings of these nodes known as edges (links). An undirected graph is represented as a set of unordered node pairs, and a directed graph is represented as a set of ordered node pairs (according to whether or not the underlying relationship is reciprocal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are used to represent networks, such as road networks in a city or devices in a computer network. Graphs are also used to represent social networks like Facebook where each person is represented as a node and each relationship between a pair of people is represented as an edge. Many optimization and search problems can be efficiently modeled in this way, and efficient algorithms have been developed to solve these problems on these graph data structures. Classic example problems would be that of a flight scheduling system for an airline, or a GPS assisted map routing services such as that provided by Google Maps.\n",
