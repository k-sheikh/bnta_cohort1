    "# Algorithms and Data Structures: Esoteric Topics (30 Min Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an optional topic intended for self-study for those students who are especially interested in esoteric topics that relate to algorithms and data structures. These topics are only intended as suggestions to get interested students started with a few of the areas that may be of interest. Consider having discussions with your fellow students, family, and friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The esoteric topics discussed here relate to historically significant developments in computing, including machine learning, cryptography, functional programming. We will also discuss traditional digital computing and the potential future of quantum computing. We will discuss the significance of these crucial developments as well as how they may impact humanity and ecology in the future. Every powerful tool is a two-edged sword. It is important to try to understand and predict the potential risks and benefits of these technological innovations, and to try to improve resulting outcomes to better our world wherever possible.\n",
