Be prepared to google search as necessary, or ask questions in class during the lab to resolve any issues. At this point in the class, it is not required that you use any advanced syntax, however, you may use any language features that you like. In most cases, your code in this lab will be fairly simple. You can easily find and copy/paste code you find on the web without the need of deep understanding. As is the case in real work world, the key is to see how resourceful you can become in resolving issues as they come up.\n",
